UI Design in Processing for elevator



## PART C

#### Issues with design:
-	Color of the buttons is the same as the background
-	Light in buttons is very small
-	Open and close buttons do not have lights which can make it feel like they did not get the press
-	“Fire Operation” is the same color as background which could be confusing
-	No indication on what the bell does

#### Why it is bad:
It is not really "bad" it is just not the best way to go about the design and could certainly use some design changes which would change the overall experience. 


## PART B

#### Common Uses:
-	Opening and closing door
-	Moving to different floor

#### Rare uses:
-	Calling for help/assistance
The common actions a user takes is keeping a door open and moving to different floor levels.

#### How does the elevator provide feedback?:
-	Sound
-	Button lights
-	Floor number

#### Common mistakes I could make:
- Click open and close several times thinking it did not work the first time
-	Accidentally clicking on bell instead of close button

#### Design changes:
-	Make “FIRE OPERATION” title a different color
-	Make buttons have blind readability so there is no confusion
-	Keep bell separate from basic usability panel
-	Put lights on open and close doors for better user feedback
-	Put buttons on a different colored surface for better user interaction and to avid any type of confusion
